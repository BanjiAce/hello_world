# hello_world
This is my first repository. I hope to learn what this is about.

## This meant to be about me.
### At least for once I make myself a priority.

I'm a 24 year-old, upcoming **Softwear Engineer** who is also a **Medical Doctor** *in trianing*. I am also a **Graphic Designer and Photographer**
This is the 1~st~ time I'm using GitHub and I hope not to produce sub-standard work.
